# 1770 — Task grammar inducer: Joint model and runtime admission

Implement the joint model and runtime admission feature for the Task grammar inducer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a grammar RLM to infer typed task-composition rules from verified examples rather than memorize surface templates.

External TASK_PROGRAMS, TYPE_CONTRACTS, and EXECUTION_RESULTS preserve effects, resource limits, successful compositions, and invalid examples. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs structural factoring, recursively proposes productions, and buffers rules only after type and witness checks. Role output: Return TASK_GRAMMAR with typed productions, effect constraints, witnesses, and rejected generalizations. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the role to identify incompatible model, adapter, child-policy, environment, and native-procedure versions. Store a typed admission plan, pinned tuple, receipts, and decision in feature_artifact; role_result retains the domain artifact. A separate authority validates compatibility and serializes admission against revocation.

Training uses generated compositional tasks, local capability fixtures, renamed primitives, nested combinations, and impossible postconditions. Independent type checking and reference execution establish solvability for controlled tasks; natural task ambiguity remains explicit. Hold out production combinations, primitive names, and nesting depths. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A grammar must reject a read-only task production requiring writes even when its training wording seems familiar. An unchanged parent generation with a revoked receipt must still fail admission. Native-improvement claims require changed instruction bytes, retained heap/session state, and no exec; a trained model's confidence alone cannot authorize activation.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/prompt_program.c`, `src/plan_dag.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/dspy_metaprogramming.py` (`MetaToolRegistry.compose`). Donor baseline: Composition chains named callables without checked cross-tool type, effect, or semantic contracts. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
