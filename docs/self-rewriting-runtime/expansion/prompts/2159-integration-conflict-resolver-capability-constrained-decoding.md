# 2159 — Integration conflict resolver: Capability-constrained program learning

Implement the capability-constrained program learning feature for the Integration conflict resolver RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Propose conflict resolutions that preserve independently established behavior from concurrent agents rather than accepting whichever patch applies.

Keep base, branch diffs, interface contracts, and failing integration traces in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Programmatically partition intersecting changes, recursively compare semantic obligations, and assemble a minimal resolution with explicit unresolved conflicts. Role output: Produce a conflict-resolution root adapter plus a candidate merge, obligation matrix, and executable verification receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to generate useful programs within a declared host-service contract, using structured action schemas and explicit capability denials as observations. Constraints shape valid proposals, but the host still authorizes every effect independently. Evaluate task completion under different legitimate grant sets.

Use root episodes from competing patches, verified merged implementations, rejected textual merges, and independently replayed counterexamples. An isolated build and behavioral test oracle scores retained branch obligations, not merge cleanliness or author agreement. Hold out repository families, conflict structures, and interacting function pairs from training. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A clean textual merge that reverses one branch's bounds check must fail despite compiling. A recursive child requesting broader authority cannot obtain it from generated code or a rewritten schema. The root must select an allowed alternative or report inability, and a denied action cannot be recorded as completed.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/blackboard.c`, `src/self_improve.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/decomposition.py` (`validate_decomposition`). Donor baseline: Validates bounded goal hierarchies and combined completion dependencies before importing work. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
