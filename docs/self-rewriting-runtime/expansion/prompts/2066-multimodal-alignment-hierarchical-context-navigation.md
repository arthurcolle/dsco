# 2066 — Multimodal evidence aligner: Hierarchical context navigation

Implement the hierarchical context navigation feature for the Multimodal evidence aligner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an alignment RLM to connect textual claims with the correct visual regions and preserve cross-modal disagreements.

External PAGE_IMAGES, TEXT_SPANS, and REGION_CANDIDATES retain page hashes, coordinates, labels, captions, and extraction variants. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs cross-reference alignment, recursively inspects disputed regions, and buffers verified links plus inconsistent readings. Role output: Return MULTIMODAL_ALIGNMENT with region handles, textual anchors, alternatives, disagreement records, and validation provenance. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Build lossless external indexes over task contexts and train the root to navigate coarse descriptors into exact evidence regions. Child RLMs inspect selected subtrees; summaries guide navigation but never replace authoritative content. Record access paths and evidence references for the final artifact.

Training combines generated charts and diagrams with known layouts, annotated papers, displaced captions, rotations, and extraction errors. Renderer metadata establishes synthetic alignment; independent visual annotation judges natural examples without pretending exact semantic ground truth. Hold out figure layouts, modality combinations, and visual degradation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A nearby caption must not attach the claim to the wrong panel when panel labels contradict proximity. A summary that omits a decisive exception must not erase the exception from the answer. Force a query requiring descent into a rarely accessed subtree and verify the exact underlying evidence is consumed.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/tools.c`, `src/execution_kernel.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_processor.py` (`PDFVisionAnalyzer._analyze_image`, `PDFVisionAnalyzer.process_pdf`). Donor baseline: Vision produces page transcription text; there is no structured equation, table, or cross-modal verification. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
