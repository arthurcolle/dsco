# 1150 — Source provenance joiner: Learned context-access planning

Implement the learned context-access planning feature for the Source provenance joiner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an evidence RLM to join reported claims with originating executions rather than copied descriptions.

External CLAIMS, SOURCE_OBJECTS, and EXECUTION_RECEIPTS retain content hashes, derivation edges, revisions, and collection boundaries. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. The root programs indexed joins, recursively delegates ambiguous ancestry checks, and buffers resolved or explicitly uncertain support paths. Role output: Return a typed PROVENANCE_JOIN containing origin edges, unresolved links, and evidence handles. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose context-region descriptors and bounded reads while keeping the full input outside the root window. Train the root to generate access programs that retrieve discriminating regions and recursively examine relevant slices. Log coverage, read amplification, and every region supporting the final artifact.

Training cases combine generated provenance graphs, real local execution receipts, copied reports, and missing parents. An independent fixture oracle checks graph ancestry and receipt identity; human adjudication handles genuinely ambiguous attribution. Hold out derivation graph shapes and report-generation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A copied benchmark summary must not become an independent confirming experiment merely because its filename differs. Plant decisive information outside the usual prefix and supply a plausible distractor near the beginning. A policy that answers from previews alone must fail the oracle, and an unbounded full-context copy must be detected.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/trace_kg_store.c`, `src/vfs.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
