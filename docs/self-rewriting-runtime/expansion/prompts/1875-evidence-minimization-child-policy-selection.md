# 1875 — Evidence set minimizer: Cost-aware child-policy selection

Implement the cost-aware child-policy selection feature for the Evidence set minimizer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an evidence RLM to find small sufficient support sets without deleting decisive counterexamples or required conditions.

External CLAIM_OBLIGATIONS and EVIDENCE_SETS preserve proof dependencies, source independence, contradictions, costs, and scope restrictions. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs deletion tests, recursively checks obligation coverage, and buffers minimal validated supports with indispensability witnesses. Role output: Return MINIMAL_EVIDENCE with retained handles, removal justifications, blocking dissent, and unresolved sufficiency. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Offer a pinned pool of child policies with measured capabilities and costs. Train the root to choose a child and context slice for each subproblem while recording actual serving identities. Optimize verified role outcomes under a shared budget, preserving conditional performance data.

Training uses generated proof graphs, controlled contract evidence, redundant observations, conditional conclusions, and adversarial distractors. Independent obligation predicates check sufficiency on formal fixtures; natural support judgments use blinded review and allow uncertainty. Hold out dependency structures, redundancy ratios, and claim families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Removing the only cancellation counterexample must not make a smaller evidence packet falsely endorse an unsafe rewrite. A cheap child that fails a rare required case must not be selected solely from its average score. Swap an endpoint's model revision and require identity failure rather than silently crediting the trained root.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/plan_dag.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
