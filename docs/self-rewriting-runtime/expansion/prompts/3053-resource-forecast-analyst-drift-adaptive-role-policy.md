# 3053 — Resource forecast analyst: Drift-adaptive role policy

Implement the drift-adaptive role policy feature for the Resource forecast analyst RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Forecast role training and recursive execution resources using measured cohorts, uncertainty, and correct dimensional relationships.

Expose workload features, observed tokens, peak memory, device time, pricing units, and comparable episodes in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively decompose demand, estimate intervals from eligible cohorts, and identify measurements dominating forecast uncertainty. Role output: Produce a resource-forecast root adapter, units-checked bounds, cohort qualification report, and predicted-versus-observed resource receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to distinguish transient anomalies, changed input distributions, and changed task semantics from chronological observations. It selects bounded diagnostic probes and proposes scoped relearning. Keep an immutable pre-change checkpoint and evaluate detection delay, false alarms, and post-change correctness.

Train roots on actual resource receipts, capacity failures, censored runs, and misleading average-only summaries. A held-out execution meter scores forecast error, interval coverage, and violations of declared hard limits. Hold out device types, input-length regimes, and recursion-topology combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Bytes per request multiplied by requests per second is bandwidth, not memory without a retention duration. One extreme outlier must not trigger wholesale relearning. A sustained change affecting the role's contract must be detected without access to future observations, and unaffected task families must retain their prior behavior.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/learned_cost.c`, `src/cost_model.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/budget.py` (`UsageMeter.total_tokens`). Donor baseline: Computes total usage including input, output, cache-read, and cache-write tokens. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
