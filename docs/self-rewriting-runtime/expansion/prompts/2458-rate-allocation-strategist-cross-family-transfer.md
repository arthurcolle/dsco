# 2458 — Rate allocation strategist: Measured cross-family transfer

Implement the measured cross-family transfer feature for the Rate allocation strategist RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Allocate limited provider request capacity among role workloads without starving critical tasks or violating endpoint quotas.

Keep queue deadlines, token estimates, quota windows, cooldowns, and role priorities as external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively partition competing demands, simulate admissible schedules, and choose allocations robust to uncertain completion times. Role output: Produce a rate-allocation root adapter, bounded admission schedule, rejected-demand reasons, and measured fairness/performance receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the role on selected development families, then compare adapted and unadapted roots on disjoint family structures with fixed leaves. Include component ablations and a negative-transfer condition. Retain task ancestry so apparent transfer cannot come from shared templates or answer leakage.

Train roots on throttled endpoint episodes, burst arrivals, heterogeneous token sizes, and known fair-scheduling outcomes. An independent quota simulator scores hard-limit compliance, completed task value, lateness, and starvation. Hold out arrival distributions, quota-reset patterns, and previously unseen role mixes. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: An allocation that achieves high throughput by permanently postponing low-volume urgent work must fail. A learned shortcut that works only for one identifier or ordering must fail on renamed and structurally changed cases. Attribute any gain to the trained root and report families harmed by the update.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/provider_pool.c`, `src/swarm_reactor.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/budget.py` (`UsageMeter.snapshot`). Donor baseline: Returns aggregate and per-model token accounting in a structured snapshot. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
