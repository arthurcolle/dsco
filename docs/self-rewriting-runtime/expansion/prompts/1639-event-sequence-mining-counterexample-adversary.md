# 1639 — Event sequence miner: Role-specific counterexample adversary

Implement the role-specific counterexample adversary feature for the Event sequence miner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a sequence RLM to discover recurring runtime behavior patterns with explicit ordering and episode boundaries.

External EVENT_STREAMS and SESSION_BOUNDARIES retain causal IDs, timestamps, dropped-event markers, revisions, and concurrency metadata. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs sequence segmentation, recursively compares recurring motifs, and buffers patterns with supporting and contradicting episodes. Role output: Return SEQUENCE_PATTERNS with ordering constraints, episode provenance, support counts, and known exceptions. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train an auxiliary root policy to generate valid challenging inputs for the role's current candidate behavior. A fixed independent referee checks input validity and confirms violations. Retain diverse minimized witnesses, and evaluate the main role against non-adaptive sealed cases as well.

Training contains generated interleavings, repeated local execution traces, missing events, retries, and renamed action labels. A separate sequence matcher checks pattern support; controlled partial-order traces supply known admissible ordering relationships. Hold out interleaving structures, motif lengths, and protocol families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Interleaved events from two requests must not become a fictional single-request failure sequence. A malformed input, altered reference, or induced harness failure cannot earn adversarial success. A genuine in-contract error must produce a reproducible witness tied to the exact candidate and environment revisions.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/event_stream.c`, `src/trace_kg_store.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/cognitive_architecture.py` (`ActionStack.pop_ready`, `CognitiveArchitecture._action_executor`). Donor baseline: Dependencies order actions, but outputs are not passed as typed prerequisite values. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
