# 1585 — Empirical reference-cohort builder: Checkpoint recovery policy training

Implement the checkpoint recovery policy training feature for the Empirical reference-cohort builder RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a cohort RLM to select empirically comparable improvement attempts without excluding inconvenient failures or unsupported contexts.

External EPISODES and ELIGIBILITY_RULES retain workloads, hardware, candidate families, failed outcomes, censoring, and selection history. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs eligibility joins, recursively inspects borderline comparators, and buffers cohort estimates with exclusion reasons. Role output: Return REFERENCE_COHORT with member identities, exclusions, denominators, estimates, and transport limitations. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Create interrupted role episodes with committed buffers, pending child calls, and explicit effect receipts. Train the root to reconstruct logical state, reconcile pending work, and continue from a compatible model/environment tuple. Treat unavailable state as a recoverable diagnostic rather than invented memory.

Training uses generated cohorts with known selection bias and actual local benchmark episodes including rejected candidates. Independent scripts verify membership and estimators; future development outcomes test predictive validity separately from final evaluation. Hold out algorithm families, hardware regimes, and selection mechanisms. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A survivor-only cohort must not portray three successes among ten attempts as a perfect success rate. Resume after an effect completed but before its acknowledgement was recorded. Reconcile the receipt instead of repeating the effect; incompatible state schemas or changed model identities must prevent a misleading continuation claim.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/learned_cost.c`, `src/cost_model.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/metacognitive_engine.py` (`MetacognitiveEngine._select_strategy`, `MetacognitiveEngine._evaluate_strategy_adjustment`). Donor baseline: Strategy selection uses fixed confidence weights and coarse success-rate thresholds. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
