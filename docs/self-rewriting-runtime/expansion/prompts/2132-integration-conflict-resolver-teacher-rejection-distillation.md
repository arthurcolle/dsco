# 2132 — Integration conflict resolver: Teacher rejection distillation

Implement the teacher rejection distillation feature for the Integration conflict resolver RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Propose conflict resolutions that preserve independently established behavior from concurrent agents rather than accepting whichever patch applies.

Keep base, branch diffs, interface contracts, and failing integration traces in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Programmatically partition intersecting changes, recursively compare semantic obligations, and assemble a minimal resolution with explicit unresolved conflicts. Role output: Produce a conflict-resolution root adapter plus a candidate merge, obligation matrix, and executable verification receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Collect multiple executable teacher trajectories per development task. Replay their programs against the fixed oracle, reject incorrect or incomplete episodes, and deduplicate shared derivations before extracting root action targets. Distill accepted trajectories into the role policy with balanced family sampling.

Use root episodes from competing patches, verified merged implementations, rejected textual merges, and independently replayed counterexamples. An isolated build and behavioral test oracle scores retained branch obligations, not merge cleanliness or author agreement. Hold out repository families, conflict structures, and interacting function pairs from training. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A clean textual merge that reverses one branch's bounds check must fail despite compiling. A fluent teacher episode containing the expected answer but an incorrect executable result must be excluded. Compare the trained root against its initial checkpoint on untouched families.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/blackboard.c`, `src/self_improve.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/decomposition.py` (`validate_decomposition`). Donor baseline: Validates bounded goal hierarchies and combined completion dependencies before importing work. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
