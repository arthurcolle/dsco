# 1931 — Discriminating experiment designer: Coverage-directed recursive traversal

Implement the coverage-directed recursive traversal feature for the Discriminating experiment designer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an experiment RLM to choose permitted probes that distinguish current hypotheses under realistic costs and controls.

External HYPOTHESES, PROBE_MENU, and OBSERVATIONS preserve predicted outcomes, costs, confounders, constraints, and uncertainty. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs design comparisons, recursively inspects discriminants, and buffers preregistered predictions before any governed probe executes. Role output: Return EXPERIMENT_DESIGN with controls, predicted branches, stopping rules, required permissions, and actual observation bindings. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Represent task partitions and their dependencies as an explicit coverage graph. Train the root to traverse unresolved frontiers, dispatch independent work, and mark a node complete only when its typed result satisfies the role contract. Preserve coverage certificates with the output object.

Training uses causal simulators and owned diagnostic fixtures with irrelevant tests, expensive discriminants, and interacting mechanisms. Independent environment outcomes score final diagnosis and cost; generated prediction prose cannot serve as experimental truth. Hold out fault mechanisms, probe names, and cost schedules. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A historically useful cheap test must be rejected when both current hypotheses predict the same result. Drop one required region while returning a plausible aggregate. The completeness check must reject it; duplicate completion messages cannot compensate for a missing node or inflate coverage.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/execution_kernel.c`, `src/plan_optimizer.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/comprehensive_reasoning_system.py` (`CausalReasoningSignature`, `ScientificReasoningWorkflow.forward`). Donor baseline: Causal relationships are requested as text; the scientific workflow leaves causal analysis unimplemented. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
