# 1251 — Citation resolver: Learned minimal-witness extraction

Implement the learned minimal-witness extraction feature for the Citation resolver RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a citation RLM to resolve each technical assertion to an actual retrievable supporting passage.

External DOCUMENT_INDEX, CITATION_MARKERS, and PAGE_SPANS retain stable document identities, references, quotations, and extraction offsets. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code follows reference chains, recursively searches candidate passages, and buffers exact matches plus unsupported citation claims. Role output: Return RESOLVED_CITATIONS with passage handles, identity evidence, support labels, and unresolved references. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to shrink a failure of this role's program, preserving its original domain obligations and fixed failure identity. It removes candidate context or program regions, recursively checks reductions, and stores a verified failure witness separately from the normal role result. Measure size and replay reliability separately.

Training cases include synthetic bibliographies, local papers, shifted pagination, duplicate titles, and fabricated citations. Exact-byte and identifier checks establish resolution; independent reviewers judge whether resolved text substantively supports the assertion. Hold out citation styles, document families, and cross-reference layouts. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A real paper title paired with an invented quotation must fail support even when citation formatting is valid. Deleting the evidence until a different error appears must be rejected as failure drift. The final witness must reproduce the original oracle mismatch, and timeout cannot establish that a removed region was unnecessary.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/semantic.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_cache.py` (`get_pdf_text_cached`, `PDFTextCache._get_file_hash`). Donor baseline: PDF extraction is content-hashed but concatenates page text without retaining page-addressed provenance. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
