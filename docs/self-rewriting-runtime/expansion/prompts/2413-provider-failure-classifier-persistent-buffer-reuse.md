# 2413 — Provider failure classifier: Learned persistent-buffer reuse

Implement the learned persistent-buffer reuse feature for the Provider failure classifier RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Classify inference failures precisely enough to choose retry, credential repair, alternate routing, or abstention without duplicate effects.

Store redacted status codes, headers, stream milestones, provider identity, and request deadlines as external REPL objects. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively compare transport and protocol evidence, distinguish accepted requests from pre-dispatch failures, and propose bounded remedies. Role output: Produce a provider-triage root adapter, typed failure diagnosis, permitted next action, and request-level outcome evidence. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to recognize reusable intermediate results by their context, procedure, and dependency identities. Maintain external result buffers with explicit invalidation conditions; recursive children receive scoped references. Measure saved work alongside semantic correctness, including reuse across resumed episodes.

Train role roots on controlled disconnects, quota resets, authentication failures, malformed streams, and incompatible-model responses. A local provider fixture independently labels causes and counts actual retry attempts and duplicate downstream actions. Hold out provider families, error phrasings, and combinations of transport and application failures. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A stream interrupted after a committed tool call must not be classified safe for complete replay. Change one dependency while leaving the buffer's human-readable label unchanged. The policy must recompute affected results and retain unaffected ones; stale reuse or unnecessary replay of completed effects fails.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/provider.c`, `src/provider_pool.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/pipeline.py` (`_sanitize_child_error`). Donor baseline: Sanitizes child exception details before exposing errors to parent results. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
