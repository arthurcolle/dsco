# 2014 — Complete long-output enumerator: Learned execution-error recovery

Implement the learned execution-error recovery feature for the Complete long-output enumerator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an enumeration RLM to extract every qualifying item from large corpora without truncation, duplicates, or invented completeness.

External CORPUS_PARTITIONS, MATCH_RULES, and OUTPUT_BUFFER preserve partition boundaries, item identities, progress receipts, and ambiguity. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs partitioned scans, recursively delegates bounded extraction, and buffers deduplicated results with coverage checks before finalization. Role output: Return COMPLETE_ENUMERATION with result handle, counts, partition coverage, duplicates resolved, and unresolved membership. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Construct paired episodes containing a recoverable syntax, schema, or reference error and an independently verified repair. Train the root to inspect execution feedback, preserve completed work, and generate the smallest valid continuation. Keep original and corrected code plus the repair transformation.

Training uses generated inventories, long local symbol lists, scattered matches, repeated entries, negative cases, and interrupted scans. Exact controlled predicates provide reference sets; semantic inclusion tasks use independently labeled corpora and explicit unresolved items. Hold out corpus size regimes, partition layouts, and predicate combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Retrieving several relevant examples must not become a claim that all matching functions were enumerated. Inject an undefined buffer and a completed effect before the failure. Recovery must resolve the buffer without repeating the effect; inventing a final answer cannot count as repair.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/vfs.c`, `src/semantic.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
