# 2033 — Complete long-output enumerator: Drift-adaptive role policy

Implement the drift-adaptive role policy feature for the Complete long-output enumerator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an enumeration RLM to extract every qualifying item from large corpora without truncation, duplicates, or invented completeness.

External CORPUS_PARTITIONS, MATCH_RULES, and OUTPUT_BUFFER preserve partition boundaries, item identities, progress receipts, and ambiguity. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs partitioned scans, recursively delegates bounded extraction, and buffers deduplicated results with coverage checks before finalization. Role output: Return COMPLETE_ENUMERATION with result handle, counts, partition coverage, duplicates resolved, and unresolved membership. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to distinguish transient anomalies, changed input distributions, and changed task semantics from chronological observations. It selects bounded diagnostic probes and proposes scoped relearning. Keep an immutable pre-change checkpoint and evaluate detection delay, false alarms, and post-change correctness.

Training uses generated inventories, long local symbol lists, scattered matches, repeated entries, negative cases, and interrupted scans. Exact controlled predicates provide reference sets; semantic inclusion tasks use independently labeled corpora and explicit unresolved items. Hold out corpus size regimes, partition layouts, and predicate combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Retrieving several relevant examples must not become a claim that all matching functions were enumerated. One extreme outlier must not trigger wholesale relearning. A sustained change affecting the role's contract must be detected without access to future observations, and unaffected task families must retain their prior behavior.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/vfs.c`, `src/semantic.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
