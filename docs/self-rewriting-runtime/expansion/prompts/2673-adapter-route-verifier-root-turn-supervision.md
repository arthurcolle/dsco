# 2673 — Adapter route verifier: Faithful root-turn supervision

Implement the faithful root-turn supervision feature for the Adapter route verifier RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Ensure each role and recursive tree receives its intended immutable adapter rather than a similarly named model.

Keep admission identities, serving receipts, cache keys, adapter digests, and in-flight generations in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively trace root and child routing, compare actual loaded identities, and isolate cross-role contamination. Role output: Produce an adapter-routing root policy, mismatched-request witnesses, corrected route bindings, and verified serving identity receipts. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Export each root decision as its exact preceding visible history and that decision's generated code. Preserve environment object identities and recursive child receipts. Train only the current root target, masking earlier turns, child replies, and tool observations; verify masks after the actual renderer tokenizes each sample.

Train roots on concurrent adapter reloads, alias collisions, stale caches, and misreported backend model names. A controlled serving backend and independent artifact checker verify the exact tensors used for each request. Hold out provider protocols, reload timings, and role-to-adapter assignment patterns. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A backend echoing the requested role name while serving another adapter must be rejected. Reject a sample whose prefix contains a later observation. A deliberately relabeled child response must receive no root target loss, and the exported sequence must replay exactly.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/provider.c`, `src/provider_pool.c`, `src/agent_profile.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/config.py` (`normalize_model_id`). Donor baseline: Maps configured aliases to canonical model strings without validating loaded adapter identity. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
