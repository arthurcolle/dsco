# 2595 — Training dataset curator: Cost-aware child-policy selection

Implement the cost-aware child-policy selection feature for the Training dataset curator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Choose role-training episodes that provide valid executable supervision without leaking holdout answers or amplifying duplicated failures.

Expose root trajectories, oracle outcomes, source ancestry, duplicate clusters, and licensing constraints as external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively classify sample eligibility, group related episodes, and construct balanced curricula with explicit exclusion reasons. Role output: Produce a dataset-curation root adapter, immutable split manifest, accepted root samples, and a quantified contamination audit. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Offer a pinned pool of child policies with measured capabilities and costs. Train the root to choose a child and context slice for each subproblem while recording actual serving identities. Optimize verified role outcomes under a shared budget, preserving conditional performance data.

Train roots on curated-versus-contaminated corpora, mislabeled success traces, duplicate families, and independently audited split decisions. A separate leakage checker and executable replay oracle score accepted samples and train/evaluation separation. Hold out repository ancestry groups, contamination mechanisms, and task-generation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A successful-looking trajectory containing future tool observations in an earlier input must be excluded. A cheap child that fails a rare required case must not be selected solely from its average score. Swap an endpoint's model revision and require identity failure rather than silently crediting the trained root.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/chronicle.c`, `src/self_improve.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/optimize.py` (`compile_with_gepa`). Donor baseline: Passes a caller-provided training set to DSPy GEPA without repository-aware data partitioning. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
