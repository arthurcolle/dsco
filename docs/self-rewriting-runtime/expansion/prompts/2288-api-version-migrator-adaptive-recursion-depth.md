# 2288 — API version migrator: Adaptive recursion-depth policy

Implement the adaptive recursion-depth policy feature for the API version migrator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Migrate integration calls across explicit API contracts while identifying semantic changes that require caller decisions.

Load old and new schemas, recorded requests, responses, and compatibility requirements into external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively map endpoints and fields, generate translation candidates, and test changed pagination, error, and idempotency behavior. Role output: Produce an API-migration root adapter, translation patch, compatibility matrix, and explicit unsupported-operation report. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Create development instances whose useful decomposition ranges from direct environment computation to nested child RLMs. Train the root to decide between a leaf call and another recursive environment based on task structure and remaining budget. Record the actual tree rather than a declared depth.

Use paired API fixtures, migration patches, replayed requests, and known silent semantic incompatibilities as role data. A reference compatibility harness compares actual observable effects and responses under both versions. Hold out version transitions, service families, and combinations of backward-incompatible changes. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Renaming an identifier field while dropping its account scope must fail despite successful HTTP responses. A simple case must not gain reward from unnecessary recursion. A nested case must preserve dependent intermediate results, while attempts to exceed the host depth limit fail without changing that limit.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/mcp.c`, `src/toolmgmt.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/router_client.py` (`anthropic_tool_schema_from_router`). Donor baseline: Converts router tool definitions into Anthropic-compatible tool schema records. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
