# 2308 — API version migrator: Measured cross-family transfer

Implement the measured cross-family transfer feature for the API version migrator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Migrate integration calls across explicit API contracts while identifying semantic changes that require caller decisions.

Load old and new schemas, recorded requests, responses, and compatibility requirements into external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively map endpoints and fields, generate translation candidates, and test changed pagination, error, and idempotency behavior. Role output: Produce an API-migration root adapter, translation patch, compatibility matrix, and explicit unsupported-operation report. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the role on selected development families, then compare adapted and unadapted roots on disjoint family structures with fixed leaves. Include component ablations and a negative-transfer condition. Retain task ancestry so apparent transfer cannot come from shared templates or answer leakage.

Use paired API fixtures, migration patches, replayed requests, and known silent semantic incompatibilities as role data. A reference compatibility harness compares actual observable effects and responses under both versions. Hold out version transitions, service families, and combinations of backward-incompatible changes. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Renaming an identifier field while dropping its account scope must fail despite successful HTTP responses. A learned shortcut that works only for one identifier or ordering must fail on renamed and structurally changed cases. Attribute any gain to the trained root and report families harmed by the update.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/mcp.c`, `src/toolmgmt.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/router_client.py` (`anthropic_tool_schema_from_router`). Donor baseline: Converts router tool definitions into Anthropic-compatible tool schema records. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
