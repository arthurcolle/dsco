# 3033 — Resource forecast analyst: Faithful root-turn supervision

Implement the faithful root-turn supervision feature for the Resource forecast analyst RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Forecast role training and recursive execution resources using measured cohorts, uncertainty, and correct dimensional relationships.

Expose workload features, observed tokens, peak memory, device time, pricing units, and comparable episodes in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively decompose demand, estimate intervals from eligible cohorts, and identify measurements dominating forecast uncertainty. Role output: Produce a resource-forecast root adapter, units-checked bounds, cohort qualification report, and predicted-versus-observed resource receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Export each root decision as its exact preceding visible history and that decision's generated code. Preserve environment object identities and recursive child receipts. Train only the current root target, masking earlier turns, child replies, and tool observations; verify masks after the actual renderer tokenizes each sample.

Train roots on actual resource receipts, capacity failures, censored runs, and misleading average-only summaries. A held-out execution meter scores forecast error, interval coverage, and violations of declared hard limits. Hold out device types, input-length regimes, and recursion-topology combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Bytes per request multiplied by requests per second is bandwidth, not memory without a retention duration. Reject a sample whose prefix contains a later observation. A deliberately relabeled child response must receive no root target loss, and the exported sequence must replay exactly.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/learned_cost.c`, `src/cost_model.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/budget.py` (`UsageMeter.total_tokens`). Donor baseline: Computes total usage including input, output, cache-read, and cache-write tokens. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
