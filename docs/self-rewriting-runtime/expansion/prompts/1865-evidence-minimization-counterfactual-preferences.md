# 1865 — Evidence set minimizer: Counterfactual branch preference training

Implement the counterfactual branch preference training feature for the Evidence set minimizer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an evidence RLM to find small sufficient support sets without deleting decisive counterexamples or required conditions.

External CLAIM_OBLIGATIONS and EVIDENCE_SETS preserve proof dependencies, source independence, contradictions, costs, and scope restrictions. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs deletion tests, recursively checks obligation coverage, and buffers minimal validated supports with indispensability witnesses. Role output: Return MINIMAL_EVIDENCE with retained handles, removal justifications, blocking dissent, and unresolved sufficiency. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Fork identical development states into isolated resettable environment snapshots or a fixed replay oracle with matched randomness. Reject comparisons when reset fidelity is uncertain. Execute alternative root programs under equal budgets, derive preferences from correctness then resource use, and train a declared preference objective on root continuations.

Training uses generated proof graphs, controlled contract evidence, redundant observations, conditional conclusions, and adversarial distractors. Independent obligation predicates check sufficiency on formal fixtures; natural support judgments use blinded review and allow uncertainty. Hold out dependency structures, redundancy ratios, and claim families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Removing the only cancellation counterexample must not make a smaller evidence packet falsely endorse an unsafe rewrite. A shorter incorrect branch must lose to a longer correct branch. Swapping presentation order must preserve the preference, and branches with different starting states must be rejected as unmatched.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/plan_dag.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
