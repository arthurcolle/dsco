# 2174 — Behavioral test selector: Contradiction-guided program revision

Implement the contradiction-guided program revision feature for the Behavioral test selector RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Select the smallest informative test set that can reject a proposed runtime change without hiding untested obligations.

Store changed functions, dependency graphs, historical failures, test costs, and contract coverage in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Decompose affected obligations recursively, compare test discrimination, and emit an ordered selection with residual coverage gaps. Role output: Produce a test-selection root adapter, executable test plan, projected cost, and explicit uncovered obligations. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Generate episodes where two independently sourced intermediate results conflict. Train the root to localize the conflicting assumptions, recursively investigate discriminating evidence, and revise dependent program steps. Retain both original claims and the evidence that resolved or preserved the disagreement.

Train root trajectories on seeded regressions, observed test outcomes, coverage relationships, and counterfactual omitted-test failures. A withheld full suite and independent mutation matrix determine whether selected tests detect material defects. Hold out defect classes, dependency shapes, and repositories rather than merely test names. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Selecting only fast passing tests while omitting the unique overflow detector must score failure. Several copied supporting reports must not overwhelm one valid counterexample. If the conflict remains unresolved, the output must preserve that state rather than select whichever child answered last.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/self_improve.c`, `src/plan_optimizer.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/pipeline.py` (`FourModelHierarchicalSwarm._coerce_subtasks`). Donor baseline: Bounds and normalizes subtask objects, supplying a fallback task when none remain. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
