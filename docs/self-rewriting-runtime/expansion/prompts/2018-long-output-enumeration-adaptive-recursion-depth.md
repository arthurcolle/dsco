# 2018 — Complete long-output enumerator: Adaptive recursion-depth policy

Implement the adaptive recursion-depth policy feature for the Complete long-output enumerator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an enumeration RLM to extract every qualifying item from large corpora without truncation, duplicates, or invented completeness.

External CORPUS_PARTITIONS, MATCH_RULES, and OUTPUT_BUFFER preserve partition boundaries, item identities, progress receipts, and ambiguity. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs partitioned scans, recursively delegates bounded extraction, and buffers deduplicated results with coverage checks before finalization. Role output: Return COMPLETE_ENUMERATION with result handle, counts, partition coverage, duplicates resolved, and unresolved membership. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Create development instances whose useful decomposition ranges from direct environment computation to nested child RLMs. Train the root to decide between a leaf call and another recursive environment based on task structure and remaining budget. Record the actual tree rather than a declared depth.

Training uses generated inventories, long local symbol lists, scattered matches, repeated entries, negative cases, and interrupted scans. Exact controlled predicates provide reference sets; semantic inclusion tasks use independently labeled corpora and explicit unresolved items. Hold out corpus size regimes, partition layouts, and predicate combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Retrieving several relevant examples must not become a claim that all matching functions were enumerated. A simple case must not gain reward from unnecessary recursion. A nested case must preserve dependent intermediate results, while attempts to exceed the host depth limit fail without changing that limit.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/vfs.c`, `src/semantic.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
