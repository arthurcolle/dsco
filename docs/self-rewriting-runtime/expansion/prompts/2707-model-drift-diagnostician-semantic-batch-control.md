# 2707 — Model drift diagnostician: Learned semantic batch control

Implement the learned semantic batch control feature for the Model drift diagnostician RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Distinguish learned-policy regression from workload drift, serving substitution, and changes in the evaluation instrument.

Expose longitudinal outcomes, task features, frozen probe results, serving identities, and scoring revisions in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively compare matched cohorts, isolate changed components, and propose discriminating replay experiments before retraining. Role output: Produce a drift-diagnosis root adapter, attribution report, matched replay plan, and justified retrain or rollback recommendation. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose variable-size partitions and token estimates to the root. Train it to choose semantic batch boundaries, call children on those batches, and join outputs by stable item identity. Include interactions crossing naive byte boundaries and charge actual calls and processed tokens.

Train roots on controlled model swaps, shifted input distributions, grader changes, and genuine capability regressions. An independent change-injection controller checks diagnosis against the known causal intervention and probe outcomes. Hold out drift types, domain transitions, and interacting model/environment changes. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A new difficult task mixture must not be mislabeled model degradation when matched-task accuracy stays constant. A boundary splitting a required dependency must trigger regrouping or explicit reconciliation. Compare fixed-size batching with learned batching under identical task and cost limits, retaining missing and duplicated items as failures.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/provider_profiles.c`, `src/self_improve.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/optimize.py` (`evaluate`). Donor baseline: Runs a DSPy evaluator over caller-supplied development examples and a metric. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
