# 3039 — Resource forecast analyst: Evidence-based stopping policy

Implement the evidence-based stopping policy feature for the Resource forecast analyst RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Forecast role training and recursive execution resources using measured cohorts, uncertainty, and correct dimensional relationships.

Expose workload features, observed tokens, peak memory, device time, pricing units, and comparable episodes in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively decompose demand, estimate intervals from eligible cohorts, and identify measurements dominating forecast uncertainty. Role output: Produce a resource-forecast root adapter, units-checked bounds, cohort qualification report, and predicted-versus-observed resource receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train a root decision among continue, return a verified environment result, and terminate unresolved. Development episodes include misleading high confidence, repetitive verification, and unresolved obligations. Optimize task completion with explicit observation requirements and costs, using oracle results rather than self-reported confidence.

Train roots on actual resource receipts, capacity failures, censored runs, and misleading average-only summaries. A held-out execution meter scores forecast error, interval coverage, and violations of declared hard limits. Hold out device types, input-length regimes, and recursion-topology combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Bytes per request multiplied by requests per second is bandwidth, not memory without a retention duration. Repeated identical child opinions cannot satisfy a missing obligation. A complete verified result should survive the stop decision unchanged; exhausted budgets must produce unresolved status instead of fabricated success.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/learned_cost.c`, `src/cost_model.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/budget.py` (`UsageMeter.total_tokens`). Donor baseline: Computes total usage including input, output, cache-read, and cache-write tokens. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
