# 3063 — Synthetic fixture author: Faithful root-turn supervision

Implement the faithful root-turn supervision feature for the Synthetic fixture author RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Generate adversarial executable fixtures with known answers that teach role procedures rather than memorized superficial cues.

Keep task grammars, semantic rules, seeds, required edge cases, and independent reference implementations in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively compose cases, derive answers through separate reference code, and reject fixtures whose labels depend on the candidate. Role output: Produce a fixture-authoring root adapter, deterministic task generator, sealed oracle outputs, and independent generator-validation report. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Export each root decision as its exact preceding visible history and that decision's generated code. Preserve environment object identities and recursive child receipts. Train only the current root target, masking earlier turns, child replies, and tool observations; verify masks after the actual renderer tokenizes each sample.

Train roots on validated fixture generators, ambiguous cases, accidental answer leaks, and independently discovered missing boundaries. A second implementation verifies answer consistency, mutation sensitivity, determinism, and absence of hidden label channels. Hold out grammar productions, semantic combinations, and generator seed families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A generated fixture placing its expected answer inside the visible filename must fail leakage validation. Reject a sample whose prefix contains a later observation. A deliberately relabeled child response must receive no root target loss, and the exported sequence must replay exactly.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/tools.c`, `src/agent_interop.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/eval_bias_reduction.py` (`calculate_detection_metrics`). Donor baseline: Computes exact normalized-label precision, recall, and F1 without generating independent task fixtures. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
