# 1186 — Quotation and modality interpreter: Learned asynchronous recursion

Implement the learned asynchronous recursion feature for the Quotation and modality interpreter RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a root RLM to preserve who asserted what, with negation, uncertainty, quotation, and endorsement intact.

External DOCUMENT_SPANS and UTTERANCE_GRAPH store exact bytes, speaker candidates, nesting, modality, and local discourse context. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code partitions discourse, recursively asks children for attribution alternatives, and verifies buffered quotations against original spans. Role output: Return ATTRIBUTED_PROPOSITIONS with modal operators, endorsement relations, quote handles, and unresolved ambiguity. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose bounded futures for recursive calls and train submit, await, batch, and cancel decisions on controlled completion distributions. Reservations span all descendants. Keep completed result identities stable and ensure training and inference scheduling never block the terminal input handler.

Training includes controlled nested quotations, conditional statements, denials, satire labels, and expert-adjudicated ambiguous passages. Template-generated examples provide exact labels; independent blinded reviewers adjudicate natural examples with disagreement preserved. Hold out discourse templates, speaker arrangements, and source genres. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A paper quoting an unsafe recommendation to refute it must not endorse that recommendation. Delay a required child indefinitely while delivering other results out of order. The system must remain responsive, preserve partial work, and report unresolved completeness; dropping the slow child cannot manufacture a successful fast result.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/session_memory.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/chunked_analyzer.py` (`KnowledgeExtractionSignature`, `ChunkedDocumentAnalyzer._aggregate_results`). Donor baseline: Extraction includes utterances and beliefs, but aggregation discards utterances and keeps only coarse chunk positions. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
