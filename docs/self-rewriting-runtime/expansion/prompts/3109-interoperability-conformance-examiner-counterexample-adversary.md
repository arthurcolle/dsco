# 3109 — Interoperability conformance examiner: Role-specific counterexample adversary

Implement the role-specific counterexample adversary feature for the Interoperability conformance examiner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Check that role runtimes honor negotiated protocol contracts across clients without mistaking permissive parsing for compatibility.

Expose protocol versions, message traces, capability negotiations, transport framing, and expected state transitions in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively enumerate boundary cases, generate protocol probes, and compare actual behavior against explicit conformance rules. Role output: Produce an interoperability root adapter, executable conformance suite, minimal failing traces, and supported-contract matrix. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train an auxiliary root policy to generate valid challenging inputs for the role's current candidate behavior. A fixed independent referee checks input validity and confirms violations. Retain diverse minimized witnesses, and evaluate the main role against non-adaptive sealed cases as well.

Train roots on valid exchanges, malformed envelopes, reordered notifications, cancellation races, and unsupported-version responses. An independent state-machine harness scores framing, identity, lifecycle, and effect semantics against controlled clients. Hold out client implementations, transport fragmentation patterns, and version-transition combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A successful initialization followed by tool calls using another session's identity must fail conformance. A malformed input, altered reference, or induced harness failure cannot earn adversarial success. A genuine in-contract error must produce a reproducible witness tied to the exact candidate and environment revisions.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/agent_interop.c`, `src/mcp_server.c`, `src/mcp_response.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/router_client.py` (`ToolRouterClient._unwrap_tools`). Donor baseline: Normalizes tool lists from supported response-envelope shapes. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
