# 2038 — Complete long-output enumerator: Measured cross-family transfer

Implement the measured cross-family transfer feature for the Complete long-output enumerator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an enumeration RLM to extract every qualifying item from large corpora without truncation, duplicates, or invented completeness.

External CORPUS_PARTITIONS, MATCH_RULES, and OUTPUT_BUFFER preserve partition boundaries, item identities, progress receipts, and ambiguity. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs partitioned scans, recursively delegates bounded extraction, and buffers deduplicated results with coverage checks before finalization. Role output: Return COMPLETE_ENUMERATION with result handle, counts, partition coverage, duplicates resolved, and unresolved membership. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the role on selected development families, then compare adapted and unadapted roots on disjoint family structures with fixed leaves. Include component ablations and a negative-transfer condition. Retain task ancestry so apparent transfer cannot come from shared templates or answer leakage.

Training uses generated inventories, long local symbol lists, scattered matches, repeated entries, negative cases, and interrupted scans. Exact controlled predicates provide reference sets; semantic inclusion tasks use independently labeled corpora and explicit unresolved items. Hold out corpus size regimes, partition layouts, and predicate combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Retrieving several relevant examples must not become a claim that all matching functions were enumerated. A learned shortcut that works only for one identifier or ordering must fail on renamed and structurally changed cases. Attribute any gain to the trained root and report families harmed by the update.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/vfs.c`, `src/semantic.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/universal_dspy_multihop.py` (`UniversalContentRetriever.retrieve`, `NotesExtractor`). Donor baseline: Retrieval merges heterogeneous scores; extracted notes have no statement-level evidence references. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
