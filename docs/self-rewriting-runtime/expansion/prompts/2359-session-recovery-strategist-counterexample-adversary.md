# 2359 — Session recovery strategist: Role-specific counterexample adversary

Implement the role-specific counterexample adversary feature for the Session recovery strategist RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Reconstruct the next valid action after interruption without replaying effects whose outcomes are already committed or uncertain.

Keep session records, checkpoints, pending operations, effect receipts, and interrupted call trees in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively reconcile each branch against durable receipts, identify resumable state, and isolate unknown remote outcomes. Role output: Produce a recovery root adapter, resumable action plan, unresolved-outcome set, and independently verified replay receipt. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train an auxiliary root policy to generate valid challenging inputs for the role's current candidate behavior. A fixed independent referee checks input validity and confirms violations. Retain diverse minimized witnesses, and evaluate the main role against non-adaptive sealed cases as well.

Use crash-injected episodes spanning pre-dispatch, post-effect, partial-stream, and checkpoint-publication boundaries as role training data. A deterministic effect ledger and replay controller score state continuity and absence of duplicated side effects. Hold out interruption boundaries, operation mixtures, and checkpoint formats from training. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A crash after remote commit but before acknowledgement must not trigger another non-idempotent execution. A malformed input, altered reference, or induced harness failure cannot earn adversarial success. A genuine in-contract error must produce a reproducible witness tied to the exact candidate and environment revisions.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/execution_recovery.c`, `src/agent.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/planning.py` (`PlannerStore._recover`). Donor baseline: Recovers expired running goals or cancels them when ancestor goals are cancelled or failed. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
