# 2933 — Asynchronous result reconciler: Drift-adaptive role policy

Implement the drift-adaptive role policy feature for the Asynchronous result reconciler RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Assemble asynchronous role outputs into a coherent decision without losing completed work or accepting stale results.

Store future identities, candidate generations, result fragments, cancellations, and dependency requirements in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively match results to requested obligations, deduplicate completions, and isolate missing or incompatible branches. Role output: Produce a result-reconciliation root adapter, coherent aggregate artifact, unresolved branch list, and replayable ownership proof. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to distinguish transient anomalies, changed input distributions, and changed task semantics from chronological observations. It selects bounded diagnostic probes and proposes scoped relearning. Keep an immutable pre-change checkpoint and evaluate detection delay, false alarms, and post-change correctness.

Train roots on reordered replies, duplicate deliveries, partial successes, cancelled calls, and stale candidate evaluations. A deterministic event-replay oracle checks exact result ownership, completion status, and final aggregate correctness. Hold out completion permutations, failure mixtures, and aggregation structures. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A late answer from an earlier candidate generation must not satisfy the current candidate's verification obligation. One extreme outlier must not trigger wholesale relearning. A sustained change affecting the role's contract must be detected without access to future observations, and unaffected task families must retain their prior behavior.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/swarm_reactor.c`, `src/execution_events.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/pipeline.py` (`FourModelHierarchicalSwarm._degraded`). Donor baseline: Returns completed child results and usage in a structured degraded response. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
