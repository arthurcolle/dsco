# 1471 — Evidence graph path reasoner: Executable curriculum compiler

Implement the executable curriculum compiler feature for the Evidence graph path reasoner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a graph RLM to construct valid explanatory paths while respecting edge type, direction, and scope.

External EVIDENCE_GRAPH and PATH_QUERIES contain typed nodes, revisioned edges, missing links, and permitted traversal rules. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code partitions graph searches, recursively delegates frontier exploration, and buffers verified paths rather than textual associations. Role output: Return CHECKED_PATHS with exact edge identities, traversal contracts, missing links, and path validity. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Compile a task grammar with explicit difficulty axes, valid transformations, and known failure labels. Generate positive and negative episodes, retaining their originating family identifiers. Train the role's root policy on a balanced development curriculum and expose a reproducible curriculum-build command.

Training uses generated typed graphs, real local execution relations, cycles, distractor hubs, and disconnected observations. An independent graph engine checks reachability and edge constraints; semantic edge assertions require separately validated provenance. Hold out graph topology, path length, and relation compositions. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A temporal-before edge must not be traversed as a causal-support edge to manufacture an explanation. Reject a generator that changes the answer without updating its reference or produces duplicate families under different seeds. Measure valid-case coverage and trained-root success separately.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/trace_kg_store.c`, `src/plan_dag.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/cognitive_architecture.py` (`ActionStack.pop_ready`, `CognitiveArchitecture._action_executor`). Donor baseline: Dependencies order actions, but outputs are not passed as typed prerequisite values. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
