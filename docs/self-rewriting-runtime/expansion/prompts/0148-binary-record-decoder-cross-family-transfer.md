# 148 — Bounded binary-record decoder: Measured cross-family transfer

Implement the measured cross-family transfer feature for the Bounded binary-record decoder RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Learn to synthesize bounded native decoders for length-prefixed journal records with explicit byte-order and checksum semantics.

External REPL variables `record_bytes`, `format_spec`, and `decode_traces` retain complete binary corpora and parser transitions. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code slices headers and payloads, recursively assigns field interpretations, then composes checked decoding states. Role output: Final environment handle resolves `DecoderCandidate` containing native artifact hash, field map, bounds contract, and executable witnesses. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the role on selected development families, then compare adapted and unadapted roots on disjoint family structures with fixed leaves. Include component ablations and a negative-transfer condition. Retain task ancestry so apparent transfer cannot come from shared templates or answer leakage.

Training episodes pair generated valid records and structural corruptions with independently executed decoder outcomes and root actions. A frozen reference decoder and checksum implementation verify exact fields, consumed offsets, rejection classes, and memory boundaries. Hold out format layouts, endian combinations, nesting depths, and corruption operators with all mutated siblings grouped. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A forged length wraps arithmetic and makes a checksum-valid prefix conceal an out-of-bounds payload access. A learned shortcut that works only for one identifier or ordering must fail on renamed and structurally changed cases. Attribute any gain to the trained root and report families harmed by the update.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/chronicle.c`, `src/execution_recovery.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/specialized_teams.py` (`CodeAnalysisToolkit.parse_python_ast`). Donor baseline: Extracts syntax structure from Python; native binary parsing is a proposed transfer. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
