# 364 — Bounded ring-buffer algorithm designer: Learned execution-error recovery

Implement the learned execution-error recovery feature for the Bounded ring-buffer algorithm designer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Learn bounded native ring-buffer procedures with explicit overwrite, backpressure, ordering, and consumer visibility contracts.

External `ring_operations`, `producer_batches`, and `consumer_views` retain operation sequences, capacities, and observed logical indices. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code separates wraparound epochs, delegates visibility cases, and synthesizes index arithmetic plus publication-order proposals. Role output: Final `RingImplementation` handle contains native code, capacity policy, synchronization contract, and replayable wraparound counterexamples. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Construct paired episodes containing a recoverable syntax, schema, or reference error and an independently verified repair. Train the root to inspect execution feedback, preserve completed work, and generate the smallest valid continuation. Keep original and corrected code plus the repair transformation.

Train from generated push/read histories, controlled interleavings, wrap defects, and exact model-checked outcome labels. A frozen sequential model or bounded linearizability checker verifies item identity, order, capacity behavior, and permitted loss. Hold out capacity shapes, producer counts, wrap frequencies, and delayed-consumer schedules with shared histories grouped. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Index wrap makes a stale slot appear newly published, duplicating one sample while silently dropping another. Inject an undefined buffer and a completed effect before the failure. Recovery must resolve the buffer without repeating the effect; inventing a final answer cannot count as repair.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/ring_buffer.c`, `src/swarm_reactor.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/specialized_teams.py` (`QueueToolkit.publish`). Donor baseline: Stores priority messages in Python lists or Redis; it does not implement native ring-buffer semantics. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
