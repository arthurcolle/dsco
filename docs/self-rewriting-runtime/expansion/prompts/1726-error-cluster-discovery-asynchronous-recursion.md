# 1726 — Error cluster discoverer: Learned asynchronous recursion

Implement the learned asynchronous recursion feature for the Error cluster discoverer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an error-analysis RLM to discover actionable failure clusters without letting duplicate wording overwhelm underlying mechanisms.

External FAILURE_EPISODES and FEATURE_TABLES retain minimal inputs, symptoms, procedure identities, observed mechanisms, and uncertain labels. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs feature extraction, recursively challenges cluster boundaries, and buffers representatives with evidence-backed merge or split decisions. Role output: Return ERROR_PARTITION with representatives, mechanism hypotheses, uncertain memberships, and cluster-specific counterexamples. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose bounded futures for recursive calls and train submit, await, batch, and cancel decisions on controlled completion distributions. Reservations span all descendants. Keep completed result identities stable and ensure training and inference scheduling never block the terminal input handler.

Training contains seeded C bugs, randomized messages, duplicate floods, interacting faults, and reviewed incident groups. Known fixture mechanisms validate controlled clusters; independent reviewers assess natural cluster usefulness with ambiguity preserved. Hold out fault families, message templates, and duplication patterns. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Thousands of duplicated timeout messages must not hide a small cluster caused by a distinct ownership defect. Delay a required child indefinitely while delivering other results out of order. The system must remain responsive, preserve partial work, and report unresolved completeness; dropping the slow child cannot manufacture a successful fast result.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/self_improve.c`, `src/trace_kg_store.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/metacognitive_engine.py` (`MetacognitiveEngine._select_strategy`, `MetacognitiveEngine._evaluate_strategy_adjustment`). Donor baseline: Strategy selection uses fixed confidence weights and coarse success-rate thresholds. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
