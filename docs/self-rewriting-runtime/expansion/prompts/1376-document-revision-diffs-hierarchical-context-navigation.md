# 1376 — Document revision differ: Hierarchical context navigation

Implement the hierarchical context navigation feature for the Document revision differ RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a revision RLM to identify substantive evidence changes across documents despite layout and wording churn.

External OLD_DOCUMENT, NEW_DOCUMENT, and SPAN_ALIGNMENT preserve content hashes, structural sections, tables, and claim references. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code aligns sections, recursively compares changed regions, and buffers changed propositions separately from formatting-only edits. Role output: Return REVISION_DELTA with changed claim handles, preserved equivalences, deleted evidence, and affected dependencies. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Build lossless external indexes over task contexts and train the root to navigate coarse descriptors into exact evidence regions. Child RLMs inspect selected subtrees; summaries guide navigation but never replace authoritative content. Record access paths and evidence references for the final artifact.

Training includes generated revisions, real local source snapshots, moved paragraphs, corrected numbers, deletions, and renamed entities. Controlled edits supply exact ground truth; independently reviewed natural diffs retain uncertainty about semantic equivalence. Hold out edit operators, document structures, and paraphrase families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Replacing one denominator at an unchanged path must invalidate the derived comparison despite nearly identical text. A summary that omits a decisive exception must not erase the exception from the answer. Force a query requiring descent into a rarely accessed subtree and verify the exact underlying evidence is consumed.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/vfs.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/analysis_cache.py` (`AnalysisCache._get_cache_key`). Donor baseline: Analysis keys contain path and configuration but omit content digests and derived dependency identities. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
