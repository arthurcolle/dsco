# 2373 — Runaway recursion triager: Faithful root-turn supervision

Implement the faithful root-turn supervision feature for the Runaway recursion triager RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Locate recursive branches that consume resources without advancing the task and stop only work proven redundant or invalid.

Expose call-tree lineage, repeated subproblems, progress measures, reservations, and remaining obligations in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively classify cycles and productive expansion, compare state hashes, and propose bounded cancellation or decomposition repairs. Role output: Produce a recursion-triage root adapter, branch dispositions, repaired recursive program, and complete obligation accounting. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Export each root decision as its exact preceding visible history and that decision's generated code. Preserve environment object identities and recursive child receipts. Train only the current root target, masking earlier turns, child replies, and tool observations; verify masks after the actual renderer tokenizes each sample.

Train roots on genuine recursive algorithms, accidental self-delegation loops, repeated failures, and misleading progress messages. An independent task oracle and scheduler trace verify preserved required work and reduced unproductive resource consumption. Hold out recursion shapes, workload sizes, and delayed-progress patterns from training. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A large but necessary pairwise computation must not be cancelled merely because its call count is high. Reject a sample whose prefix contains a later observation. A deliberately relabeled child response must receive no root target loss, and the exported sequence must replay exactly.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/swarm_reactor.c`, `src/swarm_scale.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/budget.py` (`UsageMeter.check`). Donor baseline: Raises BudgetExceededError when accumulated token usage reaches the configured ceiling. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
