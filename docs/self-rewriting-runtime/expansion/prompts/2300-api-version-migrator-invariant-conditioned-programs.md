# 2300 — API version migrator: Invariant-conditioned program generation

Implement the invariant-conditioned program generation feature for the API version migrator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Migrate integration calls across explicit API contracts while identifying semantic changes that require caller decisions.

Load old and new schemas, recorded requests, responses, and compatibility requirements into external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively map endpoints and fields, generate translation candidates, and test changed pagination, error, and idempotency behavior. Role output: Produce an API-migration root adapter, translation patch, compatibility matrix, and explicit unsupported-operation report. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Attach explicit executable invariants to development tasks and train the root to carry them through decomposition, child-result consumption, and final assembly. Check invariants outside the policy, distinguishing proven bounded conditions from sampled checks and unresolved assumptions.

Use paired API fixtures, migration patches, replayed requests, and known silent semantic incompatibilities as role data. A reference compatibility harness compares actual observable effects and responses under both versions. Hold out version transitions, service families, and combinations of backward-incompatible changes. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Renaming an identifier field while dropping its account scope must fail despite successful HTTP responses. A candidate that satisfies visible examples while violating a required invariant on a boundary case must fail. Removing the check or replacing it with the root's assurance must not change the verdict.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/mcp.c`, `src/toolmgmt.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/router_client.py` (`anthropic_tool_schema_from_router`). Donor baseline: Converts router tool definitions into Anthropic-compatible tool schema records. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
