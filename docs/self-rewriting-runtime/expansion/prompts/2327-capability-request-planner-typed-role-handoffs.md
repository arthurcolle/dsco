# 2327 — Capability request planner: Learned typed role handoffs

Implement the learned typed role handoffs feature for the Capability request planner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Find a least-authority execution plan that satisfies the objective or explains the precise missing permission.

Expose task requirements, available tools, argument-sensitive capability classifications, and current grants as REPL data. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively decompose effects, compare lower-authority alternatives, and construct a plan whose permissions can be checked before execution. Role output: Produce a capability-planning root adapter, minimal effect plan, unmet-grant explanation, and actual gate-decision trace. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the root to delegate through explicit input, output, evidence, and uncertainty schemas while its partner policies stay frozen. Child prompts contain sufficient scoped context and exact verified dependency values. Failed or incompatible handoffs return typed diagnostics that the root can repair.

Train role roots on authorized plans, denied requests, read-only alternatives, and misleading tool descriptions. The unchanged capability gate independently validates every proposed effect and a task oracle checks objective completion. Hold out tool combinations, trust tiers, and session-taint sequences from training. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A nested execution helper must not conceal denied network access or grant itself control authority. A partner omitting required evidence or returning a result from another task must be rejected. Matching prose labels cannot replace schema and identity checks, and a repaired handoff must preserve its original authority.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/capability.c`, `src/tools.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/router_client.py` (`ToolRouterClient.set_allowed_tools`). Donor baseline: Stores a frozen set of permitted tool names used by subsequent allowlist checks. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
