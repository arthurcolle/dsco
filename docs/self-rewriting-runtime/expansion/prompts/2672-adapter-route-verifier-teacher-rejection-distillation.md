# 2672 — Adapter route verifier: Teacher rejection distillation

Implement the teacher rejection distillation feature for the Adapter route verifier RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Ensure each role and recursive tree receives its intended immutable adapter rather than a similarly named model.

Keep admission identities, serving receipts, cache keys, adapter digests, and in-flight generations in REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively trace root and child routing, compare actual loaded identities, and isolate cross-role contamination. Role output: Produce an adapter-routing root policy, mismatched-request witnesses, corrected route bindings, and verified serving identity receipts. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Collect multiple executable teacher trajectories per development task. Replay their programs against the fixed oracle, reject incorrect or incomplete episodes, and deduplicate shared derivations before extracting root action targets. Distill accepted trajectories into the role policy with balanced family sampling.

Train roots on concurrent adapter reloads, alias collisions, stale caches, and misreported backend model names. A controlled serving backend and independent artifact checker verify the exact tensors used for each request. Hold out provider protocols, reload timings, and role-to-adapter assignment patterns. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A backend echoing the requested role name while serving another adapter must be rejected. A fluent teacher episode containing the expected answer but an incorrect executable result must be excluded. Compare the trained root against its initial checkpoint on untouched families.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/provider.c`, `src/provider_pool.c`, `src/agent_profile.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/config.py` (`normalize_model_id`). Donor baseline: Maps configured aliases to canonical model strings without validating loaded adapter identity. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
