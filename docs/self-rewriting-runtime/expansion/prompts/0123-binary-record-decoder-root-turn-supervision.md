# 123 — Bounded binary-record decoder: Faithful root-turn supervision

Implement the faithful root-turn supervision feature for the Bounded binary-record decoder RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Learn to synthesize bounded native decoders for length-prefixed journal records with explicit byte-order and checksum semantics.

External REPL variables `record_bytes`, `format_spec`, and `decode_traces` retain complete binary corpora and parser transitions. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code slices headers and payloads, recursively assigns field interpretations, then composes checked decoding states. Role output: Final environment handle resolves `DecoderCandidate` containing native artifact hash, field map, bounds contract, and executable witnesses. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Export each root decision as its exact preceding visible history and that decision's generated code. Preserve environment object identities and recursive child receipts. Train only the current root target, masking earlier turns, child replies, and tool observations; verify masks after the actual renderer tokenizes each sample.

Training episodes pair generated valid records and structural corruptions with independently executed decoder outcomes and root actions. A frozen reference decoder and checksum implementation verify exact fields, consumed offsets, rejection classes, and memory boundaries. Hold out format layouts, endian combinations, nesting depths, and corruption operators with all mutated siblings grouped. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A forged length wraps arithmetic and makes a checksum-valid prefix conceal an out-of-bounds payload access. Reject a sample whose prefix contains a later observation. A deliberately relabeled child response must receive no root target loss, and the exported sequence must replay exactly.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/chronicle.c`, `src/execution_recovery.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/specialized_teams.py` (`CodeAnalysisToolkit.parse_python_ast`). Donor baseline: Extracts syntax structure from Python; native binary parsing is a proposed transfer. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
