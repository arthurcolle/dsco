# 1237 — Citation resolver: Learned semantic batch control

Implement the learned semantic batch control feature for the Citation resolver RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a citation RLM to resolve each technical assertion to an actual retrievable supporting passage.

External DOCUMENT_INDEX, CITATION_MARKERS, and PAGE_SPANS retain stable document identities, references, quotations, and extraction offsets. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code follows reference chains, recursively searches candidate passages, and buffers exact matches plus unsupported citation claims. Role output: Return RESOLVED_CITATIONS with passage handles, identity evidence, support labels, and unresolved references. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose variable-size partitions and token estimates to the root. Train it to choose semantic batch boundaries, call children on those batches, and join outputs by stable item identity. Include interactions crossing naive byte boundaries and charge actual calls and processed tokens.

Training cases include synthetic bibliographies, local papers, shifted pagination, duplicate titles, and fabricated citations. Exact-byte and identifier checks establish resolution; independent reviewers judge whether resolved text substantively supports the assertion. Hold out citation styles, document families, and cross-reference layouts. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A real paper title paired with an invented quotation must fail support even when citation formatting is valid. A boundary splitting a required dependency must trigger regrouping or explicit reconciliation. Compare fixed-size batching with learned batching under identical task and cost limits, retaining missing and duplicated items as failures.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/semantic.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_cache.py` (`get_pdf_text_cached`, `PDFTextCache._get_file_hash`). Donor baseline: PDF extraction is content-hashed but concatenates page text without retaining page-addressed provenance. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
