# 2539 — Lease fencing examiner: Role-specific counterexample adversary

Implement the role-specific counterexample adversary feature for the Lease fencing examiner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Detect stale worker authority before results or code candidates can alter shared runtime state after reassignment.

Expose lease epochs, worker identities, renewal receipts, candidate versions, and reordered events through REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively reconstruct authority intervals, compare each mutation with its fencing token, and derive minimal rejection witnesses. Role output: Produce a lease-audit root adapter, authority timeline, stale-write counterexample, and concrete fencing correction proposal. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train an auxiliary root policy to generate valid challenging inputs for the role's current candidate behavior. A fixed independent referee checks input validity and confirms violations. Retain diverse minimized witnesses, and evaluate the main role against non-adaptive sealed cases as well.

Train roots on partitioned workers, expired attempts, delayed completions, renewal races, and valid ownership transfers. An independent lease state machine determines which transitions and writes are authorized at each epoch. Hold out event interleavings, clock-skew patterns, and worker failure combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: An old worker completing successfully after a replacement receives the lease must still be fenced out. A malformed input, altered reference, or induced harness failure cannot earn adversarial success. A genuine in-contract error must produce a reproducible witness tied to the exact candidate and environment revisions.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/activation_lease.c`, `src/blackboard.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/planning.py` (`PlannerStore._lease`). Donor baseline: Rejects nonrunning, mismatched, expired, or dependency-blocked goal attempts. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
