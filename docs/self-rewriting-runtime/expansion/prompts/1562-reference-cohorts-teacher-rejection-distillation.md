# 1562 — Empirical reference-cohort builder: Teacher rejection distillation

Implement the teacher rejection distillation feature for the Empirical reference-cohort builder RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a cohort RLM to select empirically comparable improvement attempts without excluding inconvenient failures or unsupported contexts.

External EPISODES and ELIGIBILITY_RULES retain workloads, hardware, candidate families, failed outcomes, censoring, and selection history. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs eligibility joins, recursively inspects borderline comparators, and buffers cohort estimates with exclusion reasons. Role output: Return REFERENCE_COHORT with member identities, exclusions, denominators, estimates, and transport limitations. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Collect multiple executable teacher trajectories per development task. Replay their programs against the fixed oracle, reject incorrect or incomplete episodes, and deduplicate shared derivations before extracting root action targets. Distill accepted trajectories into the role policy with balanced family sampling.

Training uses generated cohorts with known selection bias and actual local benchmark episodes including rejected candidates. Independent scripts verify membership and estimators; future development outcomes test predictive validity separately from final evaluation. Hold out algorithm families, hardware regimes, and selection mechanisms. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A survivor-only cohort must not portray three successes among ten attempts as a perfect success rate. A fluent teacher episode containing the expected answer but an incorrect executable result must be excluded. Compare the trained root against its initial checkpoint on untouched families.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/learned_cost.c`, `src/cost_model.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/metacognitive_engine.py` (`MetacognitiveEngine._select_strategy`, `MetacognitiveEngine._evaluate_strategy_adjustment`). Donor baseline: Strategy selection uses fixed confidence weights and coarse success-rate thresholds. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
