# 1759 — Task grammar inducer: Role-specific counterexample adversary

Implement the role-specific counterexample adversary feature for the Task grammar inducer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a grammar RLM to infer typed task-composition rules from verified examples rather than memorize surface templates.

External TASK_PROGRAMS, TYPE_CONTRACTS, and EXECUTION_RESULTS preserve effects, resource limits, successful compositions, and invalid examples. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs structural factoring, recursively proposes productions, and buffers rules only after type and witness checks. Role output: Return TASK_GRAMMAR with typed productions, effect constraints, witnesses, and rejected generalizations. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train an auxiliary root policy to generate valid challenging inputs for the role's current candidate behavior. A fixed independent referee checks input validity and confirms violations. Retain diverse minimized witnesses, and evaluate the main role against non-adaptive sealed cases as well.

Training uses generated compositional tasks, local capability fixtures, renamed primitives, nested combinations, and impossible postconditions. Independent type checking and reference execution establish solvability for controlled tasks; natural task ambiguity remains explicit. Hold out production combinations, primitive names, and nesting depths. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A grammar must reject a read-only task production requiring writes even when its training wording seems familiar. A malformed input, altered reference, or induced harness failure cannot earn adversarial success. A genuine in-contract error must produce a reproducible witness tied to the exact candidate and environment revisions.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/prompt_program.c`, `src/plan_dag.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/dspy_metaprogramming.py` (`MetaToolRegistry.compose`). Donor baseline: Composition chains named callables without checked cross-tool type, effect, or semantic contracts. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
