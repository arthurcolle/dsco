# 2769 — Training failure recovery planner: Evidence-based stopping policy

Implement the evidence-based stopping policy feature for the Training failure recovery planner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Recover failed role training without mixing checkpoints, repeating committed updates, or claiming configuration validation as training progress.

Expose optimizer steps, shard publication states, device errors, run manifests, and resume metadata in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively reconcile durable training state, identify the last coherent boundary, and construct a bounded restart plan. Role output: Produce a training-recovery root adapter, coherent resume specification, rejected recovery paths, and verified parameter-continuity report. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train a root decision among continue, return a verified environment result, and terminate unresolved. Development episodes include misleading high confidence, repetitive verification, and unresolved obligations. Optimize task completion with explicit observation requirements and costs, using oracle results rather than self-reported confidence.

Train roots on device exhaustion, interrupted saves, corrupt optimizer states, preemption, and incompatible resume attempts. An independent deterministic training fixture compares resumed parameters with an uninterrupted reference within declared tolerances. Hold out failure timings, trainer layouts, and device-error combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Resuming model weights from one step with optimizer state from another must fail before further updates. Repeated identical child opinions cannot satisfy a missing obligation. A complete verified result should survive the stop decision unchanged; exhausted budgets must produce unresolved status instead of fabricated success.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/agent_interop.c`, `src/execution_recovery.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/executor.py` (`execute_one`). Donor baseline: Claims bounded work, launches a binary, and records attempt-specific execution artifacts. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
