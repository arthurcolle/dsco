# 2960 — User correction prioritizer: Invariant-conditioned program generation

Implement the invariant-conditioned program generation feature for the User correction prioritizer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Convert user corrections into precise objective changes while retaining authorized work that the correction does not supersede.

Keep task hierarchy, original requirements, chronological corrections, current outputs, and authority boundaries in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively identify affected obligations, update priorities, and invalidate only decisions contradicted by the new instruction. Role output: Produce a correction-prioritization root adapter, revised obligation graph, preserved commitments, and an explicit scope-change explanation. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Attach explicit executable invariants to development tasks and train the root to carry them through decomposition, child-result consumption, and final assembly. Check invariants outside the policy, distinguishing proven bounded conditions from sampled checks and unresolved assumptions.

Train roots on narrow clarifications, cancellations, incompatible objective changes, and messages containing mere status questions. An independently authored requirement-state oracle checks intended scope changes and preservation of unaffected commitments. Hold out paraphrase families, correction orderings, and ambiguous references requiring abstention. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Asking for a progress update must not cancel ongoing work or authorize unrelated deployment. A candidate that satisfies visible examples while violating a required invariant on a boundary case must fail. Removing the check or replacing it with the root's assurance must not change the verdict.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/agent.c`, `src/blackboard.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/planning.py` (`PlannerStore._apply_steering`). Donor baseline: Applies queued cancellation or reprioritization to eligible goals and records resulting state changes. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
