# 1778 — Protocol state inferencer: Adaptive recursion-depth policy

Implement the adaptive recursion-depth policy feature for the Protocol state inferencer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a protocol RLM to infer hidden interaction states through bounded probes and distinguishing response sequences.

External OBSERVATION_TABLE and PROTOCOL_ORACLE retain reset receipts, action histories, outputs, counterexamples, and nondeterminism markers. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs membership queries, recursively delegates distinguishing suffixes, and buffers refined transition models with uncertainty. Role output: Return PROTOCOL_MODEL with executable transitions, query receipts, unsupported states, and reset assumptions. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Create development instances whose useful decomposition ranges from direct environment computation to nested child RLMs. Train the root to decide between a leaf call and another recursive environment based on task structure and remaining budget. Record the actual tree rather than a declared depth.

Training uses owned resettable protocol fixtures containing authentication, token consumption, retries, cancellation, and delayed failures. A separate conformance oracle checks withheld action sequences against the controlled service; uncertain resets block deterministic claims. Hold out protocol topologies, alphabets, and delayed-error structures. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Identical retry responses must remain distinct when one consumes a token needed for a later commit. A simple case must not gain reward from unnecessary recursion. A nested case must preserve dependent intermediate results, while attempts to exceed the host depth limit fail without changing that limit.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/mcp.c`, `src/pty_session.c`, `src/execution_kernel.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/comprehensive_reasoning_system.py` (`InductiveReasoningSignature`). Donor baseline: Induction requests generalizations and possible counterexamples without constructing an executable learned model. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
