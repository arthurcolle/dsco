# 2048 — Multimodal evidence aligner: Adaptive recursion-depth policy

Implement the adaptive recursion-depth policy feature for the Multimodal evidence aligner RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train an alignment RLM to connect textual claims with the correct visual regions and preserve cross-modal disagreements.

External PAGE_IMAGES, TEXT_SPANS, and REGION_CANDIDATES retain page hashes, coordinates, labels, captions, and extraction variants. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs cross-reference alignment, recursively inspects disputed regions, and buffers verified links plus inconsistent readings. Role output: Return MULTIMODAL_ALIGNMENT with region handles, textual anchors, alternatives, disagreement records, and validation provenance. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Create development instances whose useful decomposition ranges from direct environment computation to nested child RLMs. Train the root to decide between a leaf call and another recursive environment based on task structure and remaining budget. Record the actual tree rather than a declared depth.

Training combines generated charts and diagrams with known layouts, annotated papers, displaced captions, rotations, and extraction errors. Renderer metadata establishes synthetic alignment; independent visual annotation judges natural examples without pretending exact semantic ground truth. Hold out figure layouts, modality combinations, and visual degradation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A nearby caption must not attach the claim to the wrong panel when panel labels contradict proximity. A simple case must not gain reward from unnecessary recursion. A nested case must preserve dependent intermediate results, while attempts to exceed the host depth limit fail without changing that limit.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/tools.c`, `src/execution_kernel.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_processor.py` (`PDFVisionAnalyzer._analyze_image`, `PDFVisionAnalyzer.process_pdf`). Donor baseline: Vision produces page transcription text; there is no structured equation, table, or cross-modal verification. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
