# 2940 — Asynchronous result reconciler: Joint model and runtime admission

Implement the joint model and runtime admission feature for the Asynchronous result reconciler RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Assemble asynchronous role outputs into a coherent decision without losing completed work or accepting stale results.

Store future identities, candidate generations, result fragments, cancellations, and dependency requirements in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively match results to requested obligations, deduplicate completions, and isolate missing or incompatible branches. Role output: Produce a result-reconciliation root adapter, coherent aggregate artifact, unresolved branch list, and replayable ownership proof. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Train the role to identify incompatible model, adapter, child-policy, environment, and native-procedure versions. Store a typed admission plan, pinned tuple, receipts, and decision in feature_artifact; role_result retains the domain artifact. A separate authority validates compatibility and serializes admission against revocation.

Train roots on reordered replies, duplicate deliveries, partial successes, cancelled calls, and stale candidate evaluations. A deterministic event-replay oracle checks exact result ownership, completion status, and final aggregate correctness. Hold out completion permutations, failure mixtures, and aggregation structures. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A late answer from an earlier candidate generation must not satisfy the current candidate's verification obligation. An unchanged parent generation with a revoked receipt must still fail admission. Native-improvement claims require changed instruction bytes, retained heap/session state, and no exec; a trained model's confidence alone cannot authorize activation.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/swarm_reactor.c`, `src/execution_events.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/pipeline.py` (`FourModelHierarchicalSwarm._degraded`). Donor baseline: Returns completed child results and usage in a structured degraded response. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
