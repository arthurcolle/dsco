# 1900 — Change-point discoverer: Learned context-access planning

Implement the learned context-access planning feature for the Change-point discoverer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a drift RLM to segment changing runtime behavior without mistaking single incidents for new operating regimes.

External OBSERVATION_STREAM and SEGMENT_STATE retain time order, covariates, missingness, policy revisions, and prior detections. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root programs sequential tests, recursively compares segment explanations, and buffers causal decisions using only observations available then. Role output: Return REGIME_SEGMENTS with detection times, evidence windows, uncertainty, and scoped adaptation recommendations. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose context-region descriptors and bounded reads while keeping the full input outside the root window. Train the root to generate access programs that retrieve discriminating regions and recursively examine relevant slices. Log coverage, read amplification, and every region supporting the final artifact.

Training streams contain abrupt drift, gradual drift, recurring regimes, seasonal variation, isolated spikes, and workload shifts. Known simulated change schedules and independent predictive scoring validate controlled detection; real change attribution remains provisional. Hold out drift generators, time scales, and regime recurrence patterns. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: One latency spike must not trigger permanent relearning, while persistent conditional degradation must not be averaged away. Plant decisive information outside the usual prefix and supply a plausible distractor near the beginning. A policy that answers from previews alone must fail the oracle, and an unbounded full-context copy must be detected.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/event_stream.c`, `src/cost_model.c`, `src/self_improve.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-mcp-openrouter-client/metacognitive_engine.py` (`MetacognitiveEngine._select_strategy`, `MetacognitiveEngine._evaluate_strategy_adjustment`). Donor baseline: Strategy selection uses fixed confidence weights and coarse success-rate thresholds. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
