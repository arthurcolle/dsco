# 2964 — User correction prioritizer: Dependency-scoped retraining

Implement the dependency-scoped retraining feature for the User correction prioritizer RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Convert user corrections into precise objective changes while retaining authorized work that the correction does not supersede.

Keep task hierarchy, original requirements, chronological corrections, current outputs, and authority boundaries in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively identify affected obligations, update priorities, and invalidate only decisions contradicted by the new instruction. Role output: Produce a correction-prioritization root adapter, revised obligation graph, preserved commitments, and an explicit scope-change explanation. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Bind training episodes and learned procedures to content and environment dependencies. When one dependency changes, select the affected development slices and train a bounded role update with replay from unaffected families. Version the dependency graph and resulting checkpoint separately.

Train roots on narrow clarifications, cancellations, incompatible objective changes, and messages containing mere status questions. An independently authored requirement-state oracle checks intended scope changes and preservation of unaffected commitments. Hold out paraphrase families, correction orderings, and ambiguous references requiring abstention. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Asking for a progress update must not cancel ongoing work or authorize unrelated deployment. Editing content at the same path must reopen dependent learning claims. Retraining only on the changed slice must not hide regressions elsewhere, and unrelated episodes must not be relabeled stale merely to improve reported coverage.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/agent.c`, `src/blackboard.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/planning.py` (`PlannerStore._apply_steering`). Donor baseline: Applies queued cancellation or reprioritization to eligible goals and records resulting state changes. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
