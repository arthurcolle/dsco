# 1262 — Tabular evidence reconciler: Teacher rejection distillation

Implement the teacher rejection distillation feature for the Tabular evidence reconciler RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a table RLM to reconcile conflicting extracted cells before numerical evidence influences executable decisions.

External TABLE_IMAGES, CELL_GRIDS, and HEADER_MAPS preserve page identity, coordinates, units, footnotes, and extraction alternatives. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code aligns grids, recursively delegates disputed regions, and buffers verified corrections without overwriting original observations. Role output: Return RECONCILED_TABLE with cell provenance, competing readings, units, and explicit unresolved regions. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Collect multiple executable teacher trajectories per development task. Replay their programs against the fixed oracle, reject incorrect or incomplete episodes, and deduplicate shared derivations before extracting root action targets. Distill accepted trajectories into the role policy with balanced family sampling.

Training combines generated tables with exact source values and annotated real tables featuring merged headers and footnotes. A separate renderer-generation oracle validates synthetic cells; independent transcription review judges ambiguous real images. Hold out table layouts, header hierarchies, and visual degradation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A shifted column must not turn baseline memory into candidate latency despite plausible numeric ranges. A fluent teacher episode containing the expected answer but an incorrect executable result must be excluded. Compare the trained root against its initial checkpoint on untouched families.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/tools.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_processor.py` (`PDFVisionAnalyzer._analyze_image`, `PDFVisionAnalyzer.process_pdf`). Donor baseline: Vision produces page transcription text; there is no structured equation, table, or cross-modal verification. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
