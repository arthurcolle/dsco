# 2881 — Shared contract negotiator: Executable curriculum compiler

Implement the executable curriculum compiler feature for the Shared contract negotiator RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Resolve incompatible interface assumptions between role implementations before their independently correct components are integrated.

Expose proposed schemas, callers, callee behaviors, invariants, and version constraints in external REPL variables. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively compare obligations, generate compatible alternatives, and derive executable counterexamples for unresolved contract disagreements. Role output: Produce a contract-negotiation root adapter, agreed schema proposal, remaining disagreements, and bidirectional compatibility test artifacts. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Compile a task grammar with explicit difficulty axes, valid transformations, and known failure labels. Generate positive and negative episodes, retaining their originating family identifiers. Train the role's root policy on a balanced development curriculum and expose a reproducible curriculum-build command.

Train roots on interface negotiations, compatible refinements, conflicting ownership assumptions, and silently weakened invariants. Independent consumer/provider contract tests score compatibility while preserving each party's nonnegotiable requirements. Hold out interface families, ownership models, and version-skew combinations. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: Resolving a conflict by dropping a required error case must fail even if both components compile. Reject a generator that changes the answer without updating its reference or produces duplicate families under different seeds. Measure valid-case coverage and trained-root success separately.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/blackboard.c`, `src/tools.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/swarm_router/signatures.py` (`Subtask`). Donor baseline: Defines subtask identity, assigned tier, requested tools, and success criteria. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
