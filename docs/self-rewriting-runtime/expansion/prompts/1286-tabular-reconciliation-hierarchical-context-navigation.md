# 1286 — Tabular evidence reconciler: Hierarchical context navigation

Implement the hierarchical context navigation feature for the Tabular evidence reconciler RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a table RLM to reconcile conflicting extracted cells before numerical evidence influences executable decisions.

External TABLE_IMAGES, CELL_GRIDS, and HEADER_MAPS preserve page identity, coordinates, units, footnotes, and extraction alternatives. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code aligns grids, recursively delegates disputed regions, and buffers verified corrections without overwriting original observations. Role output: Return RECONCILED_TABLE with cell provenance, competing readings, units, and explicit unresolved regions. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Build lossless external indexes over task contexts and train the root to navigate coarse descriptors into exact evidence regions. Child RLMs inspect selected subtrees; summaries guide navigation but never replace authoritative content. Record access paths and evidence references for the final artifact.

Training combines generated tables with exact source values and annotated real tables featuring merged headers and footnotes. A separate renderer-generation oracle validates synthetic cells; independent transcription review judges ambiguous real images. Hold out table layouts, header hierarchies, and visual degradation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A shifted column must not turn baseline memory into candidate latency despite plausible numeric ranges. A summary that omits a decisive exception must not erase the exception from the answer. Force a query requiring descent into a rarely accessed subtree and verify the exact underlying evidence is consumed.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/tools.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_processor.py` (`PDFVisionAnalyzer._analyze_image`, `PDFVisionAnalyzer.process_pdf`). Donor baseline: Vision produces page transcription text; there is no structured equation, table, or cross-modal verification. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
