# 2206 — Flaky test diagnostician: Learned asynchronous recursion

Implement the learned asynchronous recursion feature for the Flaky test diagnostician RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Distinguish nondeterministic product defects from unreliable test infrastructure before proposing code changes or quarantining tests.

Expose repeated executions, seeds, timing, environment fingerprints, and pass/fail traces as external REPL objects. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Recursively compare failure clusters, generate discriminating reruns, and estimate which environmental factors actually change outcomes. Role output: Produce a flakiness-diagnosis root adapter, cause ranking, reproducible witness, and justified repair or quarantine proposal. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Expose bounded futures for recursive calls and train submit, await, batch, and cancel decisions on controlled completion distributions. Reservations span all descendants. Keep completed result identities stable and ensure training and inference scheduling never block the terminal input handler.

Use controlled race, clock, network, order-dependence, and faulty-assertion episodes with known injected causes. A fixture controller independently verifies causal classification and whether the proposed intervention removes the underlying failure. Hold out scheduling patterns, infrastructure perturbations, and test frameworks from training. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A real race that disappears under slower instrumentation must not be dismissed as harmless flakiness. Delay a required child indefinitely while delivering other results out of order. The system must remain responsive, preserve partial work, and report unresolved completeness; dropping the slow child cannot manufacture a successful fast result.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/self_improve.c`, `src/execution_events.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/cognitive_agent/deep.py` (`DeepReasoningProgram._run_stages`). Donor baseline: Runs sequential scan, methodology, lens, and critique model calls before synthesis. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
