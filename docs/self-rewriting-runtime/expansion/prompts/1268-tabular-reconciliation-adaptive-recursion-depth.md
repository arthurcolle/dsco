# 1268 — Tabular evidence reconciler: Adaptive recursion-depth policy

Implement the adaptive recursion-depth policy feature for the Tabular evidence reconciler RLM in `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dsco-cli` or its assigned worktree. Train a table RLM to reconcile conflicting extracted cells before numerical evidence influences executable decisions.

External TABLE_IMAGES, CELL_GRIDS, and HEADER_MAPS preserve page identity, coordinates, units, footnotes, and extraction alternatives. The root sees bounded metadata; generated REPL programs recursively call child RLMs on selected slices and retain results. Root code aligns grids, recursively delegates disputed regions, and buffers verified corrections without overwriting original observations. Role output: Return RECONCILED_TABLE with cell provenance, competing readings, units, and explicit unresolved regions. Finalize an environment handle containing `role_result`, typed `feature_artifact`, and independent training/evaluation receipts.

Create development instances whose useful decomposition ranges from direct environment computation to nested child RLMs. Train the root to decide between a leaf call and another recursive environment based on task structure and remaining budget. Record the actual tree rather than a declared depth.

Training combines generated tables with exact source values and annotated real tables featuring merged headers and footnotes. A separate renderer-generation oracle validates synthetic cells; independent transcription review judges ambiguous real images. Hold out table layouts, header hierarchies, and visual degradation families. Partition families before extracting turns; sealed evaluation never supplies training rewards or checkpoint selection.

Domain challenge: A shifted column must not turn baseline memory into candidate latency despite plausible numeric ranges. A simple case must not gain reward from unnecessary recursion. A nested case must preserve dependent intermediate results, while attempts to exceed the host depth limit fail without changing that limit.

Train actual root weights or an adapter; mask child/observation targets, fix leaf revisions, reload the checkpoint, and compare held-out outcomes at matched budgets. Declare training step/token/time caps. Supply a minimal standalone interface when shared contracts are absent.

Inspect `src/context_fabric.c`, `src/tools.c` and `/Users/arthurcolle/Dsco/dspy_multidimensional_reasoning_and_cognitive_bias_reduction/pdf_processor.py` (`PDFVisionAnalyzer._analyze_image`, `PDFVisionAnalyzer.process_pdf`). Donor baseline: Vision produces page transcription text; there is no structured equation, table, or cross-modal verification. Use focused modules and small hooks; preserve dirty work. Tool effects pass through `tools_execute_for_tier()`. Build/test privately with `DSCO_NO_INSTALL=1 make -j2 dsco`; never install worker binaries.
